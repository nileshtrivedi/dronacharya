# SmartFlightContract

a Solidity smart contract where multiple entities can approve a flight-plan.

Before the flight, every UAV will need a real-time flight-plan approval from multiple entities: DGCA (for airspace) and state/city government (for commercial movement). This multi-signature approval will be published on a blockchain so that it becomes publicly readable.
